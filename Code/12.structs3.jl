# This is a more complete example of a linked list implementation, but exists
# mainly to illustrate how to implement indexing and iteration.

# okay, this is the dirtiest hack I have ever done in julia.
# Julia is really finicky when it comes to redefining structs.
# Usually it isn't a problem if you haven't changed anything,
# but because of the recursive inclusion in the Node_ struct it was really
# unhappy, so this basically runs this if block the first time
# and not any subsequent times.
if !isdefined(@__MODULE__, :__first__)

# The node struct that actually holds the values
mutable struct Node_{T}
    data::T
    prev::Union{Node_{T}, Nothing}
    next::Union{Node_{T}, Nothing}
end

# An alias for a type union such that we can set a node to the value nothing
# when we want to indicate the end of the list.
const Node{T} = Union{Node_{T}, Nothing}

# Since we made the alias for Node, we make this wrapper for the constructor
# of the actual Node_ object. There are probably better ways to do this
# but this works fine.
function make_node(data::T, prev::Node{T}, next::Node{T}) where T

# The wrapper struct for the nodes. Most of the methods will be implemented
# on this type.
# It is also specified as a subtype of the abstract type AbstractArray.
# This signalises that it will mostly act like an array
# and makes it possible to pass a LinkedList into a function that is specified
# to take in objects of type AbstractArray. This gives a bunch of functions
# that needs to be implemented, and some that can be overridden. All of these
# are listed under the "Intefaces" section in the julia docs.
# Here we will implement the required methods and the methods for iteration.

# Constructor to create a list from a collection of elements
function LinkedList(elems::AbstractArray{T}) where T
    l = LinkedList{T}()
    for e in elems

# Not required for AbstractArray, but makes sence to implement

# One of the reqired functions for AbstractArray. size returns a tuple
# of all the dimensions, but this is a 1d collection so it only contains
# one element.
Base.size(l::LinkedList) = (l.items, )

# Implements the iteration function. This makes it possible to for example
# write something like "for element in list" to iterate through the list.
# The function returns a 2-tuple where the first element is the next iteration
# item and the second element is the next state. The state is some variable
# that determines the next element and state. When the function returns
# nothing, the loop is done.

# Implements a simple show function for nicer printing. The default show
# function is ridiculous when you have circular/recursive containment in
# your structs, so it is necessary to implement a nicer version.

# Another required function for AbstractArray.
# This function makes it possible to read the element at a certain index
# with the syntax l[i]

# The complimentary function for seting elements at a given index
# with corresponding syntax l[i] = v
Base.setindex!(l::LinkedList{T}, v::T, i::Int) where T = findnode(l, i).data = v


# Practial to override the copy function. In this case it it really
# simple to set up because of the way we made the constructor.
Base.copy(l::LinkedList) = LinkedList(l)

# Implementing the append function as well. Not necessary but practical to have.
function Base.append!(l::LinkedList{T}, l2::AbstractArray{T}) where T
    for elem in l2

# Implementing insert! for a linked list is quite useful
function Base.insert!(l::LinkedList{T}, i::Int, v::T) where T
    node = findnode(l, i)
    n_node = make_node(v, node, node.next)
    if node.next !== nothing
        node.next.prev = n_node
    end
    node.next = n_node

# Same goes for deleteat!

# It can be useful to reverse a list

        cur_node = cur_node.prev
    end
    l.head, l.tail = l.tail, l.head
    l
end

# It can also be useful to make a reversed copy of a list
Base.reverse(l::LinkedList) = reverse!(copy(l))


# Some test code:

# Creating a linked list
l = LinkedList(1 : 5)
@show l

# showing the third element
@show l[3]

# setting the third element
l[3] = 7
@show l

# inserting the value 8 between 2nd and 3rd node
insert!(l, 2, 8)
@show l

# deleting the second node
deleteat!(l, 2)
@show l

# since all required functions for AbstractArray have been implemented
# standard functions, such as sort!, should now work. However if performance
# is important you should probably implement your own version of functions
# so that it is done more efficiently for the collection in question.
# for example the sort function here will do a lot of index operations
# and since finding a node in a linked list is O(n) complexity and
# sort! is O(n log n) list operations, the whole runtime becomes O(n^2 log n).
sort!(l)
@show l
